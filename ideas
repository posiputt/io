Ideas

* Split core functionalities into several classes:
	- Connection
	- Log
	- URL expander
	- ...

* Tie them all together in a Class, that loops through them
	every of the core classes would need a function to be called on each iteration of the loop. maybe just make them callable?

Scribble

Could look like this:

con = Connection(...)
log = Log(...)
urlexp = UrlExp(...)
run = Run((con, log, urlexp))
run.do() // loop forever!
